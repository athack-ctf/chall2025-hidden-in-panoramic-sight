    Our intelligence suggests that a rogue, physical clone of Jester has somehow infiltrated and rooted itself within Interac's office building, hiding in a panoramic sight.

    Can you investigate their office, expose this hidden AI, and retrieve any information or data that can lead to its shutdown?

    You've arrived at their reception desk. Take a look at your surroundings.
